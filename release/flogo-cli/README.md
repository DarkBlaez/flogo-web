# flogo
> Command line tool for building **Flogo**-based applications.

![Flogo icon](floyd.png)

**Flogo** is process-flow engine written in Go. It was designed from the ground up to be robust enough for cloud applications and at the same time sufficiently lean for IOT devices.


## Installation
### Prerequisites
* The Go programming language should be [installed](https://golang.org/doc/install).
* In order to simplify development and building in Go, we are using the **gb** build tool.  It can be downloaded from [here](https://getgb.io).  

### Install flogo
    go get github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-cli/...

### Update flogo
    go get -u github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-cli/...
    
## Getting Started
This simple example demonstrates how to create a simple flogo application that has a log activity and REST trigger.

```bash
flogo create myApp
cd myApp

flogo add activity github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/log
flogo add trigger github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/trigger/rest
flogo add flow myflow.json
flogo build
```
